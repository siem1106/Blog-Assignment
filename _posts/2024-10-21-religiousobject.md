Religion often has symbols and objects used frequently within practice or scripture, and for Buddhism, this is the Vajra. Usually made of bronze, the vajra is an ornate sculpted object used in one of the three major branches of Buddhism, so significant that it’s used to denote the branch’s name: Vajrayana Buddhism. This branch is most commonly practiced in Tibet, where the vajra is known as a dorje, the Tibetan translation. The name vajra is more commonly used outside of Tibet, due to its origins in Indian culture.

## Origins
Vajra is Sanskrit for “diamond” or “thunderbolt,” and it historically embodies both terms. It comes from the Hindu god of rain, Indra, and it was his weapon, not unlike the ancient Greek god Zeus and his thunderbolt. Texts refer to the vajra as Indra’s thunderbolt, and he used it to fight the embodiment of drought, Vritra. As it moved into Buddhism, it shifted more towards the “diamond” meaning as it became significant of more peaceful and valuable parts of the Buddhist religion.

## Relevance
Not only is it the prefix for a major branch of the religion but it became the prefix for many relevant words within this branch. The location where Buddha attained enlightenment is known as vajrasana in Tibetan, and a yoga pose was derived from that, known as vajra asana; this pose is a strong grounding and meditative pose, helping to attain enlightenment like Buddha did. Some monks are even bestowed with the title of vajra, but this is a very high honour, as the physical vajra is used in daily religious practice, said to encapsulate all of Buddhism, and is a major part of the path to enlightenment.

## Symbolism
The vajra itself is like a sceptre, but with a much shorter staff and symbols hidden throughout its structure. Its center represents the universe’s underlying nature, sealed with an engraving of the symbol hum, shielding it from karma. Each end has three rings, signifying the three-fold bliss of Buddha, followed by a lotus, representing Samsara (endless suffering) on one end and Nirvana (release from Samsara) on the other. Most commonly there are five prongs on each end, coming together to form a dome, and these five prongs are the five Buddhas and their five wisdoms, however there are many variations on the prongs, with anywhere from one to nine being present, and variations on whether they are open or closed.

## Use
In ritual, the vajra is used in tandem with a bell called the ghanta (dril bu in Tibetan). They represent male and female powers, respectively, and balance one another. The vajra, representing upaya, or action, is held in the right hand, while the ghanta, representing pranja, or wisdom, is in the left. They are never separated, so one should not see one without the other. They are used in daily prayer, and have specific movements associated with different rituals. There are classes available from Tibetan monks for Buddhists to learn how to properly wield their vajra and ghanta. When not in use, they are placed very near or touching each other to symbolize the union of action and wisdom.
